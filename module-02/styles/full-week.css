/* 

Cascading in CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) refers to the way styles are applied to HTML elements in a hierarchical order of importance. The "cascade" aspect of CSS determines how styles are combined when multiple rules apply to a particular element. This involves three main concepts: specificity, inheritance, and the cascade order. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of each:

Specificity: This determines which style rule applies if multiple rules target the same element. Specificity is calculated based on the types of selectors used:

Inline styles have the highest specificity (e.g., <div style="color: red;">).
ID selectors (e.g., #header) have more specificity than class selectors (e.g., .nav), which in turn have more specificity than element selectors (e.g., div).
Inheritance: Some CSS properties are inherited from parent elements to child elements, while others are not. For example, text-related properties such as color and font-family are inherited, whereas box model properties like margin and border are not.

Cascade Order: When multiple rules apply to the same element, the browser determines which rule to apply based on the following order of precedence:

Importance: Rules marked with !important have the highest priority.
Origin: Styles are applied in this order of priority: user agent styles (browser default styles), user styles (styles set by the user), and author styles (styles defined by the webpage).
Specificity: More specific selectors override less specific ones.
Source Order: When specificity and importance are the same, the last rule in the CSS file overrides the earlier ones.
